# Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I was solving problems that involved dealing with algorithms and data structures, knowing which structure is more efficient than others. My runtime analysis project let me focus on how memory is used within the other data structures. The second project allowed me to read a file, sort the given information, print a list of courses in alphanumeric order, search within the list and handle exceptions well.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

When I first read the problem from project 1, I needed to understand which data structure to use because of the certain aspects from the problem. Having knowledge on which data structure to use allowed me to solve the problem with the use of efficient data manipulation. The same approach was used when programming my second project, understanding the requirments and knowing which data structure would best suit the scenario allowed me to frame the design of the overall program. Data structures are important to understand because it gives us the tools to solve problems in the most efficient way possible while also maintaining scalability.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The roadblocks I encountered were being overwhelmed with the various ways the different data structures handle data, knowing what application best fits the structure and knowing how to construct it. I find that putting the data structures next to examples made it easier for me to understand how its functionality is used, such as having items in a grocery list, a linked list would benefit this most. Pairing real world examples helped me visualize how to construct my data.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on these projects has expanded my approach by giving me the knowledge or the importance of understanding data structures because of benefits and efficiency that will come out of it. I will need to have trade-offs depending on which approach I choose when solving a problem, but knowing the pros and cons of the data structures will let me make the best choice.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work has evolved by improving my software to be more modular and adaptable. My test automation class has refinded my edge case and error handling skills, but making my program scalable is the major benefit from this course. Letting my program handle data given to it in a way that increases the life span of it is my main takeaway for how I have been evolved.
